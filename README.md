# Battleship_java
My final project in a comp sci course from 2014 - Battleship!

Note IO.java, Player.java, & Coordinate.java were provided as materials in the class. I implemented Player to customize the framework for my specific game. 

The 'AIPlayer_djw166' files do NOT contain what we call artificial intelligence, but rather simulate a player that follows a set of increasingly more complex logic rules.
